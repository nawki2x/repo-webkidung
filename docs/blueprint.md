## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC) to evoke a sense of simplicity and comfort, drawing inspiration from the natural hues of raw cotton and undyed fabrics, consistent with a minimalist aesthetic. 
- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA), maintaining a clean and uncluttered backdrop to emphasize the t-shirt designs.
- Accent color: Pale olive green (#C0C080) used sparingly for interactive elements and calls to action. The earthy tone will maintain a natural, grounding element to align with the brandâ€™s down-to-earth style.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern sans-serif, is to be used for all text on the website including headings and paragraph text. Its clarity and legibility ensure a positive user experience.
- Minimalist line icons to maintain a clean and modern look.
- Clean, minimalist design with ample white space to highlight the t-shirts and portfolio items, in a modern, casual manner. Reference: https://www.lexotex.co.id/
